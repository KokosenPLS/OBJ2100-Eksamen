# OBJ2100-Eksamen
Final exam in the course Objektorientert Programmering 2100 [OBJ2100]

The exam was to make a chat program in java using what we had learned in this course, such as thread programming and using sockets

The program consists of a client(klient) and a server(tjener)

When the server runs it opens up a port for clients to connect to, but if i remeber correctly it should only work on LAN.
When a device starts up the server, a javafx window opens up showing the all activity happening on the server in real time. That includes things like when someone connects, when they create a new room, when they send a message, when they leave a room. 

The client is just a javafx window where you first type in a username you want to display and then hit the connect button. Then you get taken to the chat app where you can see all the open chat rooms, and you can create your own chatroom and give it a name. You can enter and leave rooms, and of course send messages in those rooms.
